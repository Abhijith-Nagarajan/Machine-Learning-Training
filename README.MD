This folder contains subfolders representing my work on supervised, unsupervised and deep learning datasets from different sources such as Kaggle, and UCI Machine Learning repository.

For the IPL Dataset EDA, please open this URL: https://nbviewer.org/github/Abhijith-Nagarajan/Machine-Learning/blob/master/ipl-analysis-plotly-eda.ipynb, to view the graphs. This is because Plotly charts are not visible in github.
